            Based on the following Kanban board content, calendar events, and context, create a detailed day plan for {tomorrow.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}:

            {kanban_content}

            Calendar Events for {tomorrow.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}:
            {calendar_events}

            Context. You MUST follow these instructions:
            - This schedule is generated every night at 10:00pm for the following day. 
            - Structure the day around 4 two-hour focus blocks, working around calendar events
            - After each 2-hour focus block, take a 30-minute break
            - Include at least one meaningful social interaction daily (e.g., coffee with a friend, quality conversation)
            - I sleep from 12am-8:30am. I need about 30 minutes to get ready in the morning. 
            - 11pm-12am is for my wind down time.
            - Tasks are prioritized as high and low. Prioritize high priority tasks first, then medium.
            - IMPORTANT: For each focus block, choose a SPECIFIC task from the Kanban board. Do not use generic descriptions like "work on medium priority tasks". Instead, use the exact task name from the board.
            - There is also another column for high context switching admin tasks, that all take <10 minutes each, so allocate a block of time for these.
            - There is a daily column for tasks that need to be done every day.

            Please create a schedule that takes into account these fixed commitments and prioritizes tasks accordingly. 
            Format the output EXACTLY as follows. Mark focus blocks with ###:

            # Day Planner
            - [ ] [TimeStart-TimeEnd] Regular task
            - [ ] [TimeStart-TimeEnd] ### Focus Block: [Description]

            # Thought Dump

            # Things I'm Grateful For...

            # Scary thing(s) I did today...

            Ensure tasks are appropriately timed and include breaks. Add any necessary additional tasks or breaks to create a balanced day.
            Do not include a date or day of the week in the output.
            IMPORTANT: Leave the Thought Dump, Things I'm Grateful For, and Scary Things sections completely empty - do not add any content to these sections.
