# Claude Day Planner

Are you utilizing your time in a way that's congruent with your value system & what you want to achieve? 

## Philosophy & Motivation
I built this tool because I needed a better way to project-manage my life and address the ever-expanding backlog of things I intend to do, but somehow never get to. 

### Core Workflow
Throughout my day, I maintain a Kanban board in Obsidian to capture and prioritize tasks. It's super easy to set up - just install the community plugins. I use [this one](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban)

Each night at 10 PM, my planner:

- Analyzes my Kanban board to understand my task landscape
- Checks my Google Calendar for existing commitments
- Consults with Claude to create a schedule for the next day
- Automatically blocks out focused work sessions and writes them back to my Google Calendar

### Design Philosophy

### Design Philosophy

- **Deep Work Focus**  
I structure my day around four 2-3 hour focus blocks. I find this is the sweet spot for me. 

- **Managing My Human Limitations**  
I unfortunately suffer from being human, which means to be productive, I actually need built-in breaks for fun, exercise, sleep, and seeing friends!

- **Minimizing Decision Making**  
I realized my decision-making in the moment tends to be very poor (depleted willpower, emotional state, or immediate pressures). By automating my schedule creation, I preserve mental energy for actual execution. Removing the cognitive load of constantly deciding "what should I do next?" frees up mental resources for the work itself.

- **Building Sustainable Systems**  
Systems help me create a foundation for building good habits!
